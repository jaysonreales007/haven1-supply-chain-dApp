# Supply Chain Transparency dApp - Roadmap

## Phase 1: Planning and Setup
- [ ] Define the problem statement and user personas.
- [ ] Identify technical stack: Haven1 blockchain, Solidity, React.js, and Web3.js.
- [ ] Set up development environment:
  - Install Node.js and Web3.js.
  - Set up Haven1 RPC URL and wallet.

---

## Phase 2: Smart Contract Development
- [ ] Create a Solidity smart contract with the following functionality:
  - Register a product with origin details.
  - Update journey milestones during supply chain events.
  - Mark a product journey as complete.
  - Retrieve the full journey of a product.
- [ ] Test the contract using Truffle or Hardhat.

---

## Phase 3: Backend API (Optional)
- [ ] Create an API to interface between the frontend and blockchain for convenience.
- [ ] Integrate database (e.g., MongoDB) for caching product and user data.

---

## Phase 4: Frontend Development
- [ ] Build a React.js application for:
  - Producers: Register and manage products.
  - Supply chain participants: Update product milestones.
  - Consumers: View the product journey using a QR code scanner.
- [ ] Implement QR code generator for each product.

---

## Phase 5: Deployment
- [ ] Deploy the smart contract to the Haven1 blockchain.
- [ ] Deploy the frontend to a hosting service (e.g., Vercel or Netlify).

---

## Phase 6: Testing and Feedback
- [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing for all user roles.
- [ ] Collect feedback from stakeholders and end users.
- [ ] Address bugs and improve user experience.

---

## Phase 7: Enhancements and Scalability
- [ ] Implement token incentives for supply chain participants.
- [ ] Add multi-language support for global users.
- [ ] Explore integration with IoT devices for automated updates.

---

## Phase 8: Marketing and Adoption
- [ ] Create documentation and onboarding guides.
- [ ] Launch a pilot with a selected industry (e.g., food, luxury goods).
- [ ] Gather adoption metrics and iterate on feedback.

---

## Future Goals
- [ ] Expand to support additional industries.
- [ ] Partner with certification bodies for product authenticity verification.
- [ ] Build a mobile version of the dApp.
